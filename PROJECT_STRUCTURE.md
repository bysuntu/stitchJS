# Project Structure

## Files to Keep in Git (Active Project Files)

### Configuration & Build
- `package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts
- `webpack.config.js` - Webpack bundler configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

### Source Code (src/)
- `src/index.html` - Main HTML template
- `src/index.js` - Application entry point with VTK.js imports
- `src/ops.js` - Core algorithms (boundary detection, corner finding, polyline tracing)

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Full project documentation
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide for users
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - This file

### Scripts & Assets
- `start-dev.bat` - Windows batch file to launch dev server
- `test.stl` - Sample STL file for testing (297 KB)

### Reference Files (Original Implementations)
- `ops.jsx` - Original algorithm implementations (reference)
- `stitch.jsx` - Original usage examples (reference)

## Files Ignored by Git (in .gitignore)

### Generated Files
- `dist/` - Webpack build output (regenerated by `npm run build`)
- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies (regenerated by `npm install`)
- `package-lock.json` - NPM lock file (auto-generated)

### Old/Unused Files (Pre-Webpack)
These files are from the original CDN-based version and are no longer used:
- `app.js` - Old application file (replaced by `src/index.js`)
- `index.html` - Old HTML file (replaced by `src/index.html`)
- `ops.js` - Old ops file (replaced by `src/ops.js`)
- `test-vtk.html` - VTK.js test file (no longer needed)
- `start-server.bat` - Old Python server launcher (replaced by `start-dev.bat`)

### IDE & System Files
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/` - IDE configuration
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` - OS-generated files
- `*.log` - Log files

## What Gets Committed to Git

Essential files only:
- Source code in `src/`
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `webpack.config.js`)
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- Launch scripts (`.bat` files)
- Test assets (`test.stl`)
- Reference implementations (`.jsx` files)

**Total repository size**: ~400 KB (without node_modules or dist)

## What Gets Ignored

Generated and temporary files:
- `node_modules/` - ~200 MB of dependencies
- `dist/` - ~1 MB of built files
- `package-lock.json` - ~250 KB lock file
- Old unused files from pre-webpack setup
- IDE and OS-specific files
- Log files

## Clean Repository Commands

### Remove old unused files (optional)
```bash
# These files are replaced by src/ versions
rm app.js index.html ops.js test-vtk.html start-server.bat
```

### Check what's tracked
```bash
git status
```

### See ignored files
```bash
git status --ignored
```

## Notes

1. **Keep `ops.jsx` and `stitch.jsx`**: These are reference implementations showing the original algorithm logic

2. **Keep `test.stl`**: Even though it's 297 KB, it's essential for testing and demo purposes

3. **Don't commit `dist/`**: It's regenerated on every build, no need to version it

4. **Don't commit `node_modules/`**: It's huge (200+ MB) and regenerated by `npm install`

5. **Old root files**: The old `app.js`, `index.html`, `ops.js` are now replaced by their `src/` equivalents. You can safely delete them or keep them for reference (they're ignored by git).
